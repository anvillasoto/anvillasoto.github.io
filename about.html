    Hi, I am Alexander Villasoto from the Philippines. I graduated with the 
    degree in Information Technology, specializing in Web and Mobile 
    Applications Development. Aside from being a software developer, I have also
    interests in Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   This blog is meant for sharing stuff that I currently explore, be it in the 
   face of technology, books, movies, games, online courses or anything that
   interests me, posting them from time to time. Aside from these, I also think 
   of this blog as my motivation towards completing something. For me to have a 
   "written" record of what I am exploring.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    I will also be available for discussion for every blog. Comments and 
    suggestions are welcome and I will do my best to reply to you as soon as 
    possible. You may also email me at
