<h3><a id="day-20" href="#day-20">Day 20: Lesson 7 - Responsible AI</a></h3>
<p>Today I learned Microsoft AI principles, Modern Transparency and Explainability and Model Fairness. This is a pretty short chapter but an important chapter to discuss nonetheless.</p>
<p>Here are my opinions about this chapter:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are in awe of the wonders of AI and how it can achieve performance that even the best Go and chess players cannot fathom. But we fail to realize how important it is to responsibly use these tools. And to be honest, we do not have a collective framework as to how we do so.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Echoing Apple, privacy is indeed a human right. ML engineers and practitioners always target accuracy of their models but at the cost of sacrificing privacy of individuals, blatantly using personal information of other people without consent. This is a good read from the New York Times entitled <strong><em><a title="The Secretive Company That Might End Privacy as We Know It" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Secretive Company That Might End Privacy as We Know It</a></em></strong>&nbsp;about the incredible power of Clearview AI and how privacy of citizens are compromised.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Take <a title="Facial Recognition" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html">this piece</a> from John Oliver explaining how AI offerings by Microsoft, Google and Amazon could be used in surveilling citizens and fail miserably in recognizing faces of color. Once again, Black people and minoroities are on the losing side. Unfortunately, this biases we have as humans are adopted by these AI systems.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>I am so glad that Microsoft commits responsibility in providing these set of tools. I hope other companies will follow suit as well.</p>

<h3><a id="day-19" href="#day-19">Day 19: Lesson 6 - Operationalizing Models</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finished the labs in Operationalizing Models and Training and Deploying from a compute instance labs. This day, I officially finished lesson 6. One more pass of this chapter and I will be ready to move on to Lesson 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each lab is a great combination of easy and informative. This is getting more palatable solution for cloud ML training than SageMaker.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, check out my shiny badge from Linux Foundation:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://anvillasoto.github.io/img/posts/2020-08-01-30-days-of-udacity-nutanix-hybrid-cloud-challenge/day-19.PNG" alt="" width="500" height="558" /></p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-18" href="#day-18">Day 18: Lesson 6 - Basic and Advanced Modeling</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Continued on lesson 6 and finished lessons for basic and advanced modeling. Incredibly, this module introduced MLOps which to put it simply is DevOps when applied to Machine Learning. As they are different sets of workflow combined, machine learning engineers will be able to handle the complexities of both the environment requirements, and of course, model requirements.</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-17" href="#day-17">Day 17: Lesson 6 - Managed&nbsp; Service for Machine Learning</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I started lesson 6 and finished modules on how to manage compute resources for training and inference. It is the same as SageMaker's paradigm where we have separate compute instances for both training and inference which is a good thing since these resources can only be activated whenever you need it so it falls under the pay for what you use category.</p>
<p>In a different note, I finished half of the laboratories for my LFCS exam this coming Saturday.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-16" href="#day-16">Day 16: Lesson 5 Review</a></h3>
<p>I finished lesson 5 and now I did another review of lesson 5 before proceeding to lesson 6. I am slow but I am getting there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I participated in the weekly #sg_spaic and learned new things PowerBI and Tableau.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-15" href="#day-15">Day 15: Lesson 5 - Anomaly Detection and Forecasting</a></h3>
<p>I finished the anomaly detection and forecasting labs of lesson 5.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And on a different note, after 8 days of extensive training, I managed to finish my&nbsp;Essentials of Linux System Administration. I am glad to share my achievement, here is my certificate:<br /><br /><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://anvillasoto.github.io/img/posts/2020-08-01-30-days-of-udacity-nutanix-hybrid-cloud-challenge/day-14.png" alt="https://anvillasoto.github.io/img/posts/2020-08-01-30-days-of-udacity-nutanix-hybrid-cloud-challenge/day-14.png" width="600" height="465" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also managed to setup my workstation to enable Debian and RHEL distribution for exploring labs in preparation for the upcoming examination.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-14" href="#day-14">Day 14: Lesson 5 - Similarity Learning</a></h3>
<p>To make sure that I won't miss the fun in the course, I returned from my Linux journey to reviewing Lesson 5. I am now on Similarity Learning which is a regression modeling to compare streams of data. It is unthinkable 10 years ago to pull this off but the power of hardware today plus the feats in computer science helped pave the way to extract meaningful insights in a significantly lower amount of time with improved performance.</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-13" href="#day-13">Day 13: Finished Chapter 30 - 34 of LFS201</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am already at my 71% completion in the Essentials of Linux System Administration. And here are the things that I learned:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>User Account Management</strong> - in this chapter I learned about the attributes of different user accounts, how to create, modify, remove and lock accounts, how passwords are set, encrypted and stored including the way to schedule change of passwords for security purposes, what is <strong><em>rbash</em></strong> and how to impose that to users and enumerate how it may be circumvented by users, deep dive on roles of root account and secure shell.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Group Management</strong> - I may not use this&nbsp; in my organization due to a lack of knowledge on how they are managed but now I am pretty confident with what I learned which are quite useful including, of course its functions, commands such as <strong><em>groupadd</em></strong>, <strong><em>groupdel</em></strong>, <strong><em>groupmod</em></strong> and <strong><em>usermod</em></strong>, user private groups where created users have their own group and finally, the concept of group membership.</li>
<li><strong>File Permissions and Ownership</strong> - a review from the LFS101 introduction to this and a number of years adopting it in my workflow, I reviewed the concepts of owner, group and world, permission model between the aforesaid concepts (read, write, execute), octal file permission, distinctions between <strong><em>chmod</em></strong>, <strong><em>chown</em></strong>&nbsp;and <strong><em>chgrp</em></strong>, the role of umask to override given permissions for user, group and world, and how Linux adopts POSIX compliant <strong><em>Access Control List (ACL)</em></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)</strong> - pluggable authentication module extends the functionality of normal authentication using configuration files that may or may not be needed. In this chapter, it was discussed and aside from that, I learned about the list of steps involved in the authentication process, create new PAM rules and <strong><em>LDAP</em></strong>.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Network Addresses</strong> - IPv4, IPv6, subnet masks and setting up basic hostname.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am targeting to finish the whole lesson today in spite of work. After that, I need to streamline my progress in Azure Machine Learning. Hope I achieved that.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-12" href="#day-12">Day 12: Finished Lesson 4</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finished the final laboratory, Training a simple Clustering Model. I also had a quick rundown of Lesson 4 and I think, I am ready to proceed at lesson 5.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also finished the study jam with considerable progress. Although not in AML but in preparation to my LFCS certification due August 29.</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-11" href="#day-11">Day 11: Hurray! My First Study Jam Session</a></h3>
<p>I signed up for the study jam session to continue my lessons in supervised and unsupervised learning. And guess what? It works. I am on my last laboratory left before I do a quick run-down and proceed to Lesson 5.</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-10" href="#day-10">Day 10: Exciting Linux Journey for the Meantime</a></h3>
<p>I decided to pause a bit with AML and focus on my Linux course. I am so glad to announce that I am currently at 28% completion rate in just one day! Look!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://anvillasoto.github.io/img/posts/2020-08-01-30-days-of-udacity-nutanix-hybrid-cloud-challenge/day-10.PNG" alt="day-10.PNG" width="408" height="637" /></p>
<p>In spite of a full day's work, I managed to cover lessons off specific package managements systems from RHEL, SUSE, and Debian Distributions, not to mention their low-level counterparts (RPM and DPKG).</p>
<p>Also, system administration is getting real as I am starting System Monitoring Lesson and myriad of tools that can monitor, processes, memory, I/O and network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specific chapters that I learned today include:</p>
<ul>
<li>RPM - low-level, local and no-dependency resolution package management tool for RHEL distributions.</li>
<li>DPKG -&nbsp;low-level, local and no-dependency resolution package management tool for Debian distributions.</li>
<li>YUM - high-level package management tool for almost all RHEL distributions with remote updates from multiple repositories and robust dependency resolution.</li>
<li>ZYPPER -&nbsp; an extension of YUM package manager&nbsp; for SUSE.</li>
<li>APT - same with yum but for Debian distros like Ubuntu and Linux Mint.</li>
<li>System Monitoring - particularly the sar tool which gatthers reports about system activity in a human-readable fashion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also documented my experience <a title="Essentials of Linux System Administration (LFS201) Course Journey" href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/08/13/essentials-of-linux-system-administration-course-journey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Check it out, won't you?</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-9" href="#day-9">Day 9: I am Finally in Lesson 4: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I got a hands-on with the two labs in this lesson, two class classifiers and multi-class algorithms. I was also acquainted (again) with regression algorithms as part of the final lessons in my day 8 review where I was introduced to discrete and continuous supervised algorithms.</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-8" href="#day-8">Day 8: Reviewed Lesson 3 - Model Training</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reviewed data importing and transformation, feature engineering, monitoring data drift with the added functionality of versioning datasets right within the platform, difference between continuous and discrete outputs of supervised machine learning and the evaluation metrics depending on the classification algorithm.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-7" href="#day-7">Day 7: Finished Lesson 3 - Model Training</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally I finished the rest of the labs particularly training and evaluating a model using different evaluation metrics, simulating classical machine learning model using boosted decision tree for binary classification and the exciting new feature of Azure Machine Learning which is AutoML. I will definitely explore this topic more.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On a different note, finally, after about 10 days of staggered progress, I am glad to announce that I already finished the course with the last chapter about Local Security Principles which includes interesting topics such as (1) Linux Security, (2) the root privileges and when to reflect it among regular users, (3) limiting hardware access, (4) working with updates and (5) securing the boot process and hardware resources. It was a great journey. I may apply for a financial aid for this one to pursue a verified certificate.</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-6" href="#day-6">Day 6: Did the 2nd and third Labs in Lesson 3 - Model Training</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now this is new, in the current beta version of the AML platform, we can version the dataset. Back when I was using it in my Microsoft Professional Program classes, you need to create separate projects for separate versions of the dataset. Or at least renaming the files that are used in modeling. I am really enjoying my experience in the course. I wish I had a large screen to take them all in without window resizing. :D</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-5" href="#day-5">Day 5: Finished the First Laboratory of Lesson 3</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I finished the first laboratory of Lesson 3: Model Training where I explored the Extract-Transform-Load pipeline right within Azure Machine Learnig Platform. Like I said, it is the same as before. But I am interested in custom functions for ETL (either in Python or R).&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-4" href="#day-4">Day 4: It is Time for a Review</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just yesterday, I finished the whole lesson 2. But to get it fully, I decided to have a comprehensive run-down of the lesson again. And it is nice to play with the labs, albeit it resets&nbsp; after an hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On a very different note, I decided to continue on my foray to re-learn things Linux as I revealed on day 1. It may not be related to this challenge but it is my milestone anyway.&nbsp;So far, I am really astounded as to how much have I missed especially on the text editors and and user environment aspects of Linux which are lessons 11 and 12 of edX's Introduction to Linux created by the Linux Foundation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chapter 11 involves the use of&nbsp; editors for myriad of tasks. I am a fan of <strong><em>nano</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><em>gedit&nbsp;</em></strong>but I now appreciate why other power users are preferring <strong><em>vi</em></strong> and <strong><em>emacs</em></strong>&nbsp;to do some file manipulation heavy lifting apart from them being lightweight, console-based and predated the text editors introduced later.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chapter 12 in the other hand involves accounts and user groups, how to change file ownership and permissions, assign users and groups to files and directories recursively and the <strong><em>history | grep</em></strong> combo. I learned most of these in my daily work espcially during CI/CD setup tasks (deploying pertinent files to http servers with wrong directory permissions challenged me before but not until I knew several ownership and modification of users/groups).&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-3" href="#day-3">Day 3: Finished Second Half of Lesson 2</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I successfully finished lesson 2 which is a bit of a nostalgia for me. You see, I was accuustomed to the drag-and-drop functionality of Azure Machine Learning in the early days (2017) where I was exploring the wonders of machine learning. It is nice to see they retained the same for the newer environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://anvillasoto.github.io/img/posts/2020-08-01-50-days-of-udacity-machine-learning-scholarship-for-microsoft-azure/lab-2.PNG" alt="" width="800" height="540" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Look at the newer version of Azure Machine Learning now, it is pretty neat. And with a compact integration with the Udacity workspace, albeit its small real estate and user's viewing capacity, even with negative zoom level, it is still incredibly usable, I dare say better than SageMaker. I am looking forward to further lessons.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-2" href="#day-2">Day 2: Started Lesson 2 - Introduction to Machine Learning</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finished the first half of Lesson 2 from the importance of machine learning, historical context, the data science pipeline, data types, and the two perpectives on Machine Learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my opinion, I think we started data science way before the buzzword was first used. Through statistical models that carried out census to visualizations that are hand-drawn. It was until the power of hardware today plus the advancements in programming languages that find a common ground between computer scientists and statisticians to date that data science becomes applicable, and for good reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quick side note, I am also trying to brush up my skills in Linux by taking up Introduction to Linux (LFS101x) from edX in collaboration with the Linux Foundation. This is in preparation to the Essentials of Linux System Administration that I plan to take later this month. You can read more about my experience <a title="LFS101x: Introduction to Linux" href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/08/02/lfs101x-introduction-to-linux.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="day-1" href="#day-1">Day 1: Setting Up My Blog</a></h3>
<p>I am excited to announce that I recently finished the Intel Edge AI for IoT Developers Nanodegree from Udacity. Read my experience <a href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/07/30/intel-edge-ai-nanodegree.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is also my first time setting up and writing my blog.&nbsp;This blog is meant for sharing stuff that I currently explore, be it in the face of technology, books, movies, games, online courses or anything that interests me, posting them from time to time. Aside from these, I also think of this blog as my motivation towards completing something. For me to have a "written" record of what I am exploring.</p>
