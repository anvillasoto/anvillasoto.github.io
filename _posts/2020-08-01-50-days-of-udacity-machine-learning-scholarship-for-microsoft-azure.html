<h3><a id="day-7" href="#day-7">Day 7: Finished Lesson 3 - Model Training</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally I finished the rest of the labs particularly training and evaluating a model using different evaluation metrics, simulating classical machine learning model using boosted decision tree for binary classification and the exciting new feature of Azure Machine Learning which is AutoML. I will definitely explore this topic more.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On a different note, finally, after about 10 days of staggered progress, I am glad to announce that I already finished the course with the last chapter about Local Security Principles which includes interesting topics such as (1) Linux Security, (2) the root privileges and when to reflect it among regular users, (3) limiting hardware access, (4) working with updates and (5) securing the boot process and hardware resources. It was a great journey. I may apply for a financial aid for this one to pursue a verified certificate.</p>

<h3><a id="day-6" href="#day-6">Day 6: Did the 2nd and third Labs in Lesson 3 - Model Training</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now this is new, in the current beta version of the AML platform, we can version the dataset. Back when I was using it in my Microsoft Professional Program classes, you need to create separate projects for separate versions of the dataset. Or at least renaming the files that are used in modeling. I am really enjoying my experience in the course. I wish I had a large screen to take them all in without window resizing. :D</p>

<h3><a id="day-5" href="#day-5">Day 5: Finished the First Laboratory of Lesson 3</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I finished the first laboratory of Lesson 3: Model Training where I explored the Extract-Transform-Load pipeline right within Azure Machine Learnig Platform. Like I said, it is the same as before. But I am interested in custom functions for ETL (either in Python or R).&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="day-4" href="#day-4">Day 4: It is Time for a Review</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just yesterday, I finished the whole lesson 2. But to get it fully, I decided to have a comprehensive run-down of the lesson again. And it is nice to play with the labs, albeit it resets&nbsp; after an hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On a very different note, I decided to continue on my foray to re-learn things Linux as I revealed on day 1. It may not be related to this challenge but it is my milestone anyway.&nbsp;So far, I am really astounded as to how much have I missed especially on the text editors and and user environment aspects of Linux which are lessons 11 and 12 of edX's Introduction to Linux created by the Linux Foundation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chapter 11 involves the use of&nbsp; editors for myriad of tasks. I am a fan of <strong><em>nano</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><em>gedit&nbsp;</em></strong>but I now appreciate why other power users are preferring <strong><em>vi</em></strong> and <strong><em>emacs</em></strong>&nbsp;to do some file manipulation heavy lifting apart from them being lightweight, console-based and predated the text editors introduced later.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chapter 12 in the other hand involves accounts and user groups, how to change file ownership and permissions, assign users and groups to files and directories recursively and the <strong><em>history | grep</em></strong> combo. I learned most of these in my daily work espcially during CI/CD setup tasks (deploying pertinent files to http servers with wrong directory permissions challenged me before but not until I knew several ownership and modification of users/groups).&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="day-3" href="#day-3">Day 3: Finished Second Half of Lesson 2</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I successfully finished lesson 2 which is a bit of a nostalgia for me. You see, I was accuustomed to the drag-and-drop functionality of Azure Machine Learning in the early days (2017) where I was exploring the wonders of machine learning. It is nice to see they retained the same for the newer environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://anvillasoto.github.io/img/posts/2020-08-01-50-days-of-udacity-machine-learning-scholarship-for-microsoft-azure/lab-2.PNG" alt="" width="800" height="540" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Look at the newer version of Azure Machine Learning now, it is pretty neat. And with a compact integration with the Udacity workspace, albeit its small real estate and user's viewing capacity, even with negative zoom level, it is still incredibly usable, I dare say better than SageMaker. I am looking forward to further lessons.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="day-2" href="#day-2">Day 2: Started Lesson 2 - Introduction to Machine Learning</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finished the first half of Lesson 2 from the importance of machine learning, historical context, the data science pipeline, data types, and the two perpectives on Machine Learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my opinion, I think we started data science way before the buzzword was first used. Through statistical models that carried out census to visualizations that are hand-drawn. It was until the power of hardware today plus the advancements in programming languages that find a common ground between computer scientists and statisticians to date that data science becomes applicable, and for good reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quick side note, I am also trying to brush up my skills in Linux by taking up Introduction to Linux (LFS101x) from edX in collaboration with the Linux Foundation. This is in preparation to the Essentials of Linux System Administration that I plan to take later this month. You can read more about my experience <a title="LFS101x: Introduction to Linux" href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/08/02/lfs101x-introduction-to-linux.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="day-1" href="#day-1">Day 1: Setting Up My Blog</a></h3>
<p>I am excited to announce that I recently finished the Intel Edge AI for IoT Developers Nanodegree from Udacity. Read my experience <a href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/07/30/intel-edge-ai-nanodegree.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is also my first time setting up and writing my blog.&nbsp;This blog is meant for sharing stuff that I currently explore, be it in the face of technology, books, movies, games, online courses or anything that interests me, posting them from time to time. Aside from these, I also think of this blog as my motivation towards completing something. For me to have a "written" record of what I am exploring.</p>
