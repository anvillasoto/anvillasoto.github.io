<h3><a id="day-3" href="#day-3">Day 3: Finished Second Half of Lesson 2</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I successfully finished lesson 2 which is a bit of a nostalgia for me. You see, I was accuustomed to the drag-and-drop functionality of Azure Machine Learning in the early days (2017) where I was exploring the wonders of machine learning. It is nice to see they retained the same for the newer environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://anvillasoto.github.io/img/posts/2020-08-01-50-days-of-udacity-machine-learning-scholarship-for-microsoft-azure/lab-2.PNG" alt="" width="800" height="540" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Look at the newer version of Azure Machine Learning now, it is pretty neat. And with a compact integration with the Udacity workspace, albeit its small real estate and user's viewing capacity, even with negative zoom level, it is still incredibly usable, I dare say better than SageMaker. I am looking forward to further lessons.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="day-2" href="#day-2">Day 2: Started Lesson 2 - Introduction to Machine Learning</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finished the first half of Lesson 2 from the importance of machine learning, historical context, the data science pipeline, data types, and the two perpectives on Machine Learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my opinion, I think we started data science way before the buzzword was first used. Through statistical models that carried out census to visualizations that are hand-drawn. It was until the power of hardware today plus the advancements in programming languages that find a common ground between computer scientists and statisticians to date that data science becomes applicable, and for good reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quick side note, I am also trying to brush up my skills in Linux by taking up Introduction to Linux (LFS101x) from edX in collaboration with the Linux Foundation. This is in preparation to the Essentials of Linux System Administration that I plan to take later this month. You can read more about my experience <a title="LFS101x: Introduction to Linux" href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/08/02/lfs101x-introduction-to-linux.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="day-1" href="#day-1">Day 1: Setting Up My Blog</a></h3>
<p>I am excited to announce that I recently finished the Intel Edge AI for IoT Developers Nanodegree from Udacity. Read my experience <a href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/07/30/intel-edge-ai-nanodegree.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is also my first time setting up and writing my blog.&nbsp;This blog is meant for sharing stuff that I currently explore, be it in the face of technology, books, movies, games, online courses or anything that interests me, posting them from time to time. Aside from these, I also think of this blog as my motivation towards completing something. For me to have a "written" record of what I am exploring.</p>
