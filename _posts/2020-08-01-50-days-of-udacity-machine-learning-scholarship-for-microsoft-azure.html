<h3><a id="day-1" href="#day-1">Day 1: Setting Up My Blog</a></h3>
<p>I am excited to announce that I recently finished the Intel Edge AI for IoT Developers Nanodegree from Udacity. Read my experience <a href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/07/30/intel-edge-ai-nanodegree.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is also my first time setting up and writing my blog.&nbsp;This blog is meant for sharing stuff that I currently explore, be it in the face of technology, books, movies, games, online courses or anything that interests me, posting them from time to time. Aside from these, I also think of this blog as my motivation towards completing something. For me to have a "written" record of what I am exploring.</p>
