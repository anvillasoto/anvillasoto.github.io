<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 30px;"><strong>tl;dr; I thought I don't need this, turns out I do.</strong></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">August 3, 2020</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is like I am treading a memory lane when I decided to revisit my previous lessons in the basics of Linux as part of my foray towards&nbsp; being a certified Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator this August. You see, the prerequisite for the companion certification course is LFS101x so I decided to give it a go and brush up my skills. Turns out I need it more than I think.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You see, the course started to the promise of the Linux Foundation, the history of Linus Torvalds announcing his pet project to the public in which, to his words, <strong><em>"...won't be big or professional like GNU"</em></strong>. The course also tackles the Linux Philosophy and gleans towards common Linux distros particularly from Debian and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ok, I know&nbsp; the Linux basics, the Graphical Interface (well, some parts of it since I am a big Ubuntu desktop user) and how to navigate for the most part using the GNOME desktop interface. I also had significant experience using common applications for Ubuntu since I used it as the default operating system of my underpowered machine. Full disclosure, this salvaged me from my college days, with Ubuntu requiring CPU and RAM at a minimum, privileges I could not have to avail Windows at its utmost potential.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My progress in the course is a breeze until Chapter 7: Command Line Operations. I realized that there's more to the command line than the usual commands&nbsp; that I know for both CentOS and Ubuntu. Aside from the usual commands for working with files, I realized the power of searching for files and an in-depth discussion of pipes from standard input, output and error streams. I also learned <strong><em>locate</em></strong> and <strong><em>find - exec</em></strong> commands which were powerful tools to locate files instead of me just using <strong><em>ls -s | grep &lt;file_that_i_want_to_look_at&gt; </em></strong>which obviously is not the correct and efficient way to go especially when you want to recursively do things from these collections of files you found. I also learned a deeper understanding of <strong><em>dpkg</em></strong> and <strong><em>rpm</em></strong>, in that it is used for package/s without dependencies vs their equivalent <strong><em>apt</em></strong>, <strong><em>yum</em></strong>, and <strong><em>zypper</em></strong>&nbsp;(which I just learned, sorry openSUSE fans) which handle dependency checks for installation and removal. Coming from my usual yum and apt commands, these are all invaluable tools that I can add in my command-line arsenal.&nbsp;</p>
