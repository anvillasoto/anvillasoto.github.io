<h3><a id="day-4" href="#day-4">Day 4: Finished Lessons 11 and 12 of LFS101x</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As preparation again to Linux Certified SysAdmin Examination, I am playing safe by re-learning how to navigate Linux. So far, I am really astounded as to how much have I missed especially on the text editors and and user environment aspects of Linux which are lessons 11 and 12 of edX's Introduction to Linux created by the Linux Foundation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chapter 11 involves the use of&nbsp; editors for myriad of tasks. I am a fan of <strong><em>nano</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><em>gedit&nbsp;</em></strong>but I now appreciate why other power users are preferring <strong><em>vi</em></strong> and <strong><em>emacs</em></strong>&nbsp;to do some file manipulation heavy lifting apart from them being lightweight, console-based and predated the text editors introduced later.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chapter 12 in the other hand involves accounts and user groups, how to change file ownership and permissions, assign users and groups to files and directories recursively and the <strong><em>history | grep</em></strong> combo. I learned most of these in my daily work espcially during CI/CD setup tasks (deploying pertinent files to http servers with wrong directory permissions challenged me before but not until I knew several ownership and modification of users/groups). I am really excited to continue my journey. While we are at it, please read my experience (updated daily) about this course <a title="LFS101x: Introduction to Linux" href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/08/02/lfs101x-introduction-to-linux.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="day-3" href="#day-3">Day 3: Finished Lessons 8-10 of LFS101x</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finished three lessons this day, in spite of hard day's work. Brushed up my knowledge in (1) Finding Linux Documentation - the use of <em><strong>man</strong></em> and <strong><em>infopages</em></strong>, (2) Processes as well as changing the priority or niceness values (I did not know we have gnome-system-monitor and just learned it), and file operations both from the command line and using GUI.

<h3><a id="day-2" href="#day-2">Day 2: Started Introduction to Linux (LFS101) from edX and Linux Foundation</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am trying to brush up my skills in Linux by taking up Introduction to Linux (LFS101x) from edX in collaboration with the Linux Foundation. It has been 3 years since I use Linux in my day-to-day job previously as a researcher and currently as a systems administrator in my company but I encounter commands that I wish I knew before. Additionally, this is also in preparation to the Essentials of Linux System Administration that I plan to take later this month. You can read more about my experience <a title="LFS101x: Introduction to Linux" href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/08/02/lfs101x-introduction-to-linux.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="day-1" href="#day-1">Day 1: Setting Up My Blog</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am excited to announce that I recently finished the Intel Edge AI for IoT Developers Nanodegree from Udacity. Read my experience <a href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/07/30/intel-edge-ai-nanodegree.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is also my first time setting up and writing my blog.&nbsp;This blog is meant for sharing stuff that I currently explore, be it in the face of technology, books, movies, games, online courses or anything that interests me, posting them from time to time. Aside from these, I also think of this blog as my motivation towards completing something. For me to have a "written" record of what I am exploring.</p>
