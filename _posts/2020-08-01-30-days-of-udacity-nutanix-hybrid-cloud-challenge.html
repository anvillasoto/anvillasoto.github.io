<h3><a id="day-12" href="#day-12">Day 12: Finished Chapter 20 - 29 of LFS201</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am already at my 63% mark in Essentials of Linux System Administration and finished 29 out of 44 chapters. Specifically, I am through with the following lessons:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The ext2/ext3/ext4 Filesystems</strong> - learned about the history of the current <strong><em>ext4</em></strong> filesystem being adopted in most Linux distros, its layout and improvement compare to its predecessors, data blocks and<strong><em> inodes</em></strong> as well as the <strong><em>dumpe2fs</em></strong> and <strong><em>tune2fs</em></strong> utilities to scan and modify filesystem parameters respectively.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The XFS and BTRFS Filesystems</strong> - learned how <strong><em>XFS</em></strong> has become the filesystem option for large datasets and <strong><em>btrfs</em></strong> for SLES and SUSE due to its robust COW mechanism.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Encrypting Disks</strong> - introduced with the need for encryption, what is <strong><em>Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS)</em></strong>, and acquainted with <strong><em>cryptsetup</em></strong>, a go-to tool to encrypt volumes and use mount/unmount options right within the said tool to use the encrypted volumes like normal ones.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Logical Volume Management</strong> - learned about what it is about (well, it uses combinations of physical disks to multiple or unified virtual partitions, essentially abstracting physical drives in the process), physical volumes, volume groups, logical volumes, as well as myriad of tools to display and resize these volumes, all without worrying where they came from.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RAID</strong> - explained how Linux natively support RAID configurations, both hardware and software to introduce redundancy and recovery from failure (depending on RAID levels which also explained in this chapter).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kernel Services and Configuration</strong> - go deep about the kernel and how it is being called during boot using kernel command line, kernel boot parameters and how to change these parameters at runtime using sysctl and also which parameters are editable at runtime.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Kernel Modules</strong> - this one, I felt a little bit of nostalgia due to the nature of my work as a kernel developer. I used <strong><em>lsmod</em></strong>, <strong><em>insmod</em></strong>, <strong><em>depmod</em></strong> and <strong><em>modprobe</em></strong> commands to load and install kernel modules that I modified to facilitate exposing of values in the user-space, all of which are explained in great detail.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Devices and udev</strong> - explained in great detail the nature of device nodes, how they are usually named and the avoidance of overwhelming the operating system with device drivers by loading important drivers on-demand using <strong><em>udev</em></strong>. Of course, udev was also discussed at length with rules and where to store them.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Virtualization Overview</strong> - explained what is virtualization, its history, distinctions between hosts and guests, difference between emulation and virtualization (emulation translate instructions to a different architecture and run on the same environment vs virtualization which directly passes instructions to the underlying parent architecture). This is a lengthy chapter in that there is also a separate discussion about hypervisors, libvirt (a tool to encompass common virtualization and emulatiion technologies like Xen and QEMU), QEMU, and of course KVM.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Containers Overview</strong> - extensibly explained the difference between containers and virtual machines (containers are special environments for specific applications while virtual machines are environments with their own operating system and require extensive resources), <strong><em>Docker</em></strong> of course, and a more obscure but performant alternative to Docker, <strong><em>Podman</em></strong>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also did several interesting reads about (1) <a title="The Btrfs filesystem: An introduction" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/576276/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">btrfs</a> by the creator himself, Jonathan Corbet and (2)&nbsp;<a title="Xen and the new processors" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/182080/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xen and the new processors</a> - early virtualization tool for Linux that take advantage of Intel's VT-x and AMD's SVM to provide specialized privilege levels for hypervisors and guests.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Man, this is a lot to process! Still, I though I share it with you. This I think is my initial step towards appreciating Nutanix cloud offerings more, which adopted strategies for cloud offered by Linux.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As usual, I am logging all of my progress in <a title="Essentials of Linux System Administration (LFS201) Course Journey" href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/08/13/essentials-of-linux-system-administration-course-journey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this separate blog post</a>.

<h3><a id="day-11" href="#day-11">Day 11: Finished Chapter 12 - 19 of LFS201</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;It is Saturday and a very productive one! I am currently at my 42% mark in Essentials of Linux System Administration and I am on my 2nd day. I tackled big chapters which include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Process monitoring -</strong> with <em><strong>ps</strong></em>, <strong><em>pstree</em></strong> and<strong><em> top.</em></strong></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Memory monitoring and usage - talks about how to access memory information as well as virtual memory settings using <strong><em>/proc</em></strong> pseudo filesystem, access virtual memory statistics using <strong><em>vmstat</em></strong> and discusses OOM killer.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I/O monitoring and tuning</strong> - discusses disk bottlenecks and how to investigate with them using <strong><em>iostat</em></strong>, <strong><em>iotop</em></strong> and <strong><em>ionice</em></strong>.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I/O scheduling</strong> - talks about algorithms like <strong><em>CFQ</em></strong> which mainly for non-rotational storage devices and <strong><em>deadline</em></strong> for HDDs.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Linux Filesystems and the VFS</strong> - introduces filesystems, <strong><em>inodes</em></strong>, distinctions between hard and soft links, filesystem tree, encompassing journal vs proprietary filesystems with VFS and varieties of filesystems available to and supported by Linux.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Disk Partitioning</strong> - tackles disk geometry for conventional HDDs, partition organization, <em><strong>MBR</strong></em> vs <strong><em>GPT</em></strong> partition tables, SCSI devices, <strong><em>blkid</em></strong>, <strong><em>lsblk</em></strong> and using <strong><em>fdisk</em></strong> and <strong><em>gparted</em></strong> tools to modify transitions or break ones if not careful :D</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Filesystem Features: Attributes, Creating, Checking and Mounting</strong> - using lsattr and chattr to list and change attributes of different filesystems supported by Linux, use mkfs and fsck for making filesystems and check their integrities respectively, mounting filesystems using mount, unmounting them using umount, using NFS (not the racing car game one but a Network File System) and have the ability to automatically mount filesystems using automount utility or modifying the /etc/fstab config file.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a treat, here is a funny depiction of OOM in action.</p>

<h3><a id="day-10" href="#day-10">Day 10: Finished Chapter 6 - 11 of LFS201</a></h3>
<p>I am so glad to announce that I am currently at 28% completion rate in just one day! Look!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://anvillasoto.github.io/img/posts/2020-08-01-30-days-of-udacity-nutanix-hybrid-cloud-challenge/day-10.PNG" alt="day-10.PNG" width="408" height="637" /></p>
<p>In spite of a full day's work, I managed to cover lessons off specific package managements systems from RHEL, SUSE, and Debian Distributions, not to mention their low-level counterparts (RPM and DPKG).</p>
<p>Also, system administration is getting real as I am starting System Monitoring Lesson and myriad of tools that can monitor, processes, memory, I/O and network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specific chapters that I learned today include:</p>
<ul>
<li>RPM - low-level, local and no-dependency resolution package management tool for RHEL distributions.</li>
<li>DPKG -&nbsp;low-level, local and no-dependency resolution package management tool for Debian distributions.</li>
<li>YUM - high-level package management tool for almost all RHEL distributions with remote updates from multiple repositories and robust dependency resolution.</li>
<li>ZYPPER -&nbsp; an extension of YUM package manager&nbsp; for SUSE.</li>
<li>APT - same with yum but for Debian distros like Ubuntu and Linux Mint.</li>
<li>System Monitoring - particularly the sar tool which gatthers reports about system activity in a human-readable fashion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also documented my experience <a title="Essentials of Linux System Administration (LFS201) Course Journey" href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/08/13/essentials-of-linux-system-administration-course-journey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Check it out, won't you?</p>

<h3><a id="day-9" href="#day-9">Day 9: Finished Chapter 2 - 5 of LFS201</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finished lessons Linux Filesystem Tree Layout, Processes and Signals and Package Management Systems for RHEL, Debian and openSUSE Linux distribution chapters of LFS201.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-8" href="#day-8">Day 8: Now I am in the LFS201</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I don't want to sound overly ecstatic but here I am! I am now in the first chapter of LFS201 - Essentials of Linux System Administration. It is not much since I need to finish 45 chapters until August 29 but I am getting there! Wish me luck!</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-6" href="#day-6">Day 6: Finished Chapters 15-17 of LFS101x</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today I reviewed the bash shell and basic scripting which contains lessons for syntax, constructs which are similar to programming constructs, only cooler, and their features and capabilities. Before I was quite apprehensive to adopt this in my daily work but now, I have some ideas on how to make my life easier especially on scheduling tasks right within the executable bash script. Finally, I learned printing (documents of course). It may sound basic to others but these are the capabilities that we somehow take for granted that Linux can do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am now excited to learn Local Security Principles as the culmination of the course. After that, I am ready to explore&nbsp;Essentials of Linux System Administration. Wish me luck!</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-5" href="#day-5">Day 5: Finished Chapters 13-14 of LFS101x</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was a very productive Saturday with Lessons 13 and 14 finished for the Introduction to Linux course, specific to tips and tricks on how to manipulate text from standard input like <strong><em>cat</em></strong> and <strong><em>echo</em></strong>, <strong><em>sed</em></strong> and <strong><em>awk</em> </strong>and the all powerful <strong><em>grep</em></strong> command as well as comprehensive introduction to network operations, network configuration, and <strong><em>wget</em> </strong>and <strong><em>curl</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-4" href="#day-4">Day 4: Finished Lessons 11 and 12 of LFS101x</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Day 4: Finished Lessons 11 and 12 of LFS101x as preparation again to Linux Certified SysAdmin Examination, I am playing safe by re-learning how to navigate Linux. So far, I am really astounded as to how much have I missed especially on the text editors and and user environment aspects of Linux which are lessons 11 and 12 of edX's Introduction to Linux created by the Linux Foundation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chapter 11 involves the use of&nbsp;editors for myriad of tasks. I am a fan of&nbsp;<strong data-stringify-type="bold"><em data-stringify-type="italic">nano</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong data-stringify-type="bold"><em data-stringify-type="italic">gedit&nbsp;</em></strong>but I now appreciate why other power users are preferring&nbsp;<strong data-stringify-type="bold"><em data-stringify-type="italic">vi</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong data-stringify-type="bold"><em data-stringify-type="italic">emacs</em></strong>&nbsp;to do some file manipulation heavy lifting apart from them being lightweight, console-based and predated the text editors introduced later.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chapter 12 in the other hand involves accounts and user groups, how to change file ownership and permissions, assign users and groups to files and directories recursively and the&nbsp;<strong data-stringify-type="bold"><em data-stringify-type="italic">history | grep</em></strong>&nbsp;combo. I learned most of these in my daily work espcially during CI/CD setup tasks (deploying pertinent files to http servers with wrong directory permissions challenged me before but not until I knew several ownership and modification of users/groups). I am really excited to continue my journey. While we are at it, please read my experience (updated daily) about this course&nbsp;<a class="c-link" href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/08/02/lfs101x-introduction-to-linux.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/08/02/lfs101x-introduction-to-linux.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent" aria-describedby="sk-tooltip-2366">here</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="day-3" href="#day-3">Day 3: Finished Lessons 8-10 of LFS101x</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finished three lessons this day, in spite of hard day's work. Brushed up my knowledge in (1) Finding Linux Documentation - the use of <em><strong>man</strong></em> and <strong><em>infopages</em></strong>, (2) Processes as well as changing the priority or niceness values (I did not know we have gnome-system-monitor and just learned it), and file operations both from the command line and using GUI. You can read more updates about my experience in this course <a title="LFS101x: Introduction to Linux" href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/08/02/lfs101x-introduction-to-linux.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="day-2" href="#day-2">Day 2: Started Introduction to Linux (LFS101) from edX and Linux Foundation</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am trying to brush up my skills in Linux by taking up Introduction to Linux (LFS101x) from edX in collaboration with the Linux Foundation. It has been 3 years since I use Linux in my day-to-day job previously as a researcher and currently as a systems administrator in my company but I encounter commands that I wish I knew before. Additionally, this is also in preparation to the Essentials of Linux System Administration that I plan to take later this month. You can read more about my experience <a title="LFS101x: Introduction to Linux" href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/08/02/lfs101x-introduction-to-linux.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="day-1" href="#day-1">Day 1: Setting Up My Blog</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am excited to announce that I recently finished the Intel Edge AI for IoT Developers Nanodegree from Udacity. Read my experience <a href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/07/30/intel-edge-ai-nanodegree.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is also my first time setting up and writing my blog.&nbsp;This blog is meant for sharing stuff that I currently explore, be it in the face of technology, books, movies, games, online courses or anything that interests me, posting them from time to time. Aside from these, I also think of this blog as my motivation towards completing something. For me to have a "written" record of what I am exploring.</p>
