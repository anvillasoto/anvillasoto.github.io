<h3><a id="day-9" href="#day-9">Day 10: Finished Chapter 6 - 11 of LFS201</a></h3>
<p>I am so glad to announce that I am currently at 28% completion rate in just one day! Look!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://anvillasoto.github.io/img/posts/2020-08-01-30-days-of-udacity-nutanix-hybrid-cloud-challenge/day-10.PNG" alt="day-10.PNG" width="408" height="637" /></p>
<p>In spite of a full day's work, I managed to cover lessons off specific package managements systems from RHEL, SUSE, and Debian Distributions, not to mention their low-level counterparts (RPM and DPKG).</p>
<p>Also, system administration is getting real as I am starting System Monitoring Lesson and myriad of tools that can monitor, processes, memory, I/O and network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specific chapters that I learned today include:</p>
<ul>
<li>RPM - low-level, local and no-dependency resolution package management tool for RHEL distributions.</li>
<li>DPKG -&nbsp;low-level, local and no-dependency resolution package management tool for Debian distributions.</li>
<li>YUM - high-level package management tool for almost all RHEL distributions with remote updates from multiple repositories and robust dependency resolution.</li>
<li>ZYPPER -&nbsp; an extension of YUM package manager&nbsp; for SUSE.</li>
<li>APT - same with yum but for Debian distros like Ubuntu and Linux Mint.</li>
<li>System Monitoring - particularly the sar tool which gatthers reports about system activity in a human-readable fashion.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also documented my experience <a title="Essentials of Linux System Administration (LFS201) Course Journey" href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/08/13/essentials-of-linux-system-administration-course-journey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Check it out, won't you?</p>

<h3><a id="day-9" href="#day-9">Day 9: Finished Chapter 2 - 5 of LFS201</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finished lessons Linux Filesystem Tree Layout, Processes and Signals and Package Management Systems for RHEL, Debian and openSUSE Linux distribution chapters of LFS201.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-8" href="#day-8">Day 8: Now I am in the LFS201</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I don't want to sound overly ecstatic but here I am! I am now in the first chapter of LFS201 - Essentials of Linux System Administration. It is not much since I need to finish 45 chapters until August 29 but I am getting there! Wish me luck!</p>
<hr />
<h3><a id="day-6" href="#day-6">Day 6: Finished Chapters 15-17 of LFS101x</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today I reviewed the bash shell and basic scripting which contains lessons for syntax, constructs which are similar to programming constructs, only cooler, and their features and capabilities. Before I was quite apprehensive to adopt this in my daily work but now, I have some ideas on how to make my life easier especially on scheduling tasks right within the executable bash script. Finally, I learned printing (documents of course). It may sound basic to others but these are the capabilities that we somehow take for granted that Linux can do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am now excited to learn Local Security Principles as the culmination of the course. After that, I am ready to explore&nbsp;Essentials of Linux System Administration. Wish me luck!</p>

<h3><a id="day-5" href="#day-5">Day 5: Finished Chapters 13-14 of LFS101x</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was a very productive Saturday with Lessons 13 and 14 finished for the Introduction to Linux course, specific to tips and tricks on how to manipulate text from standard input like <strong><em>cat</em></strong> and <strong><em>echo</em></strong>, <strong><em>sed</em></strong> and <strong><em>awk</em> </strong>and the all powerful <strong><em>grep</em></strong> command as well as comprehensive introduction to network operations, network configuration, and <strong><em>wget</em> </strong>and <strong><em>curl</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="day-4" href="#day-4">Day 4: Finished Lessons 11 and 12 of LFS101x</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Day 4: Finished Lessons 11 and 12 of LFS101x as preparation again to Linux Certified SysAdmin Examination, I am playing safe by re-learning how to navigate Linux. So far, I am really astounded as to how much have I missed especially on the text editors and and user environment aspects of Linux which are lessons 11 and 12 of edX's Introduction to Linux created by the Linux Foundation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chapter 11 involves the use of&nbsp;editors for myriad of tasks. I am a fan of&nbsp;<strong data-stringify-type="bold"><em data-stringify-type="italic">nano</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong data-stringify-type="bold"><em data-stringify-type="italic">gedit&nbsp;</em></strong>but I now appreciate why other power users are preferring&nbsp;<strong data-stringify-type="bold"><em data-stringify-type="italic">vi</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong data-stringify-type="bold"><em data-stringify-type="italic">emacs</em></strong>&nbsp;to do some file manipulation heavy lifting apart from them being lightweight, console-based and predated the text editors introduced later.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chapter 12 in the other hand involves accounts and user groups, how to change file ownership and permissions, assign users and groups to files and directories recursively and the&nbsp;<strong data-stringify-type="bold"><em data-stringify-type="italic">history | grep</em></strong>&nbsp;combo. I learned most of these in my daily work espcially during CI/CD setup tasks (deploying pertinent files to http servers with wrong directory permissions challenged me before but not until I knew several ownership and modification of users/groups). I am really excited to continue my journey. While we are at it, please read my experience (updated daily) about this course&nbsp;<a class="c-link" href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/08/02/lfs101x-introduction-to-linux.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/08/02/lfs101x-introduction-to-linux.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent" aria-describedby="sk-tooltip-2366">here</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="day-3" href="#day-3">Day 3: Finished Lessons 8-10 of LFS101x</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finished three lessons this day, in spite of hard day's work. Brushed up my knowledge in (1) Finding Linux Documentation - the use of <em><strong>man</strong></em> and <strong><em>infopages</em></strong>, (2) Processes as well as changing the priority or niceness values (I did not know we have gnome-system-monitor and just learned it), and file operations both from the command line and using GUI.

<h3><a id="day-2" href="#day-2">Day 2: Started Introduction to Linux (LFS101) from edX and Linux Foundation</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am trying to brush up my skills in Linux by taking up Introduction to Linux (LFS101x) from edX in collaboration with the Linux Foundation. It has been 3 years since I use Linux in my day-to-day job previously as a researcher and currently as a systems administrator in my company but I encounter commands that I wish I knew before. Additionally, this is also in preparation to the Essentials of Linux System Administration that I plan to take later this month. You can read more about my experience <a title="LFS101x: Introduction to Linux" href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/08/02/lfs101x-introduction-to-linux.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="day-1" href="#day-1">Day 1: Setting Up My Blog</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am excited to announce that I recently finished the Intel Edge AI for IoT Developers Nanodegree from Udacity. Read my experience <a href="https://anvillasoto.github.io/2020/07/30/intel-edge-ai-nanodegree.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is also my first time setting up and writing my blog.&nbsp;This blog is meant for sharing stuff that I currently explore, be it in the face of technology, books, movies, games, online courses or anything that interests me, posting them from time to time. Aside from these, I also think of this blog as my motivation towards completing something. For me to have a "written" record of what I am exploring.</p>
